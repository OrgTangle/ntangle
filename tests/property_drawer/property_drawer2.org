** Heading 1.1
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args:emacs-lisp: :tangle no
:END:
At Org level 2.

Only the emacs-lisp block will *not* be tangled from this subtree.
#+name: block2
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "this block will *not* be tangled")
#+end_src

But the below Nim block will tangle fine (though incorrectly to the
foo.el file!).
#+name: block3
#+begin_src nim
echo "this block will be tangled to foo.el too!"
#+end_src

- Note :: ~ntangle~ creates /block3/ *below* /block1/ in the tangled
          ~foo.el~, while ~org-bable-tangle~ reverses that order. It's
          not clear why that's the case with ~org-babel-tangle~ if
          /block3/ is appearing *after* /block1/ in this Org
          file. Assuming that that's a bug in Org mode, ~ntangle~ is
          not copying that behavior right now. <2018-10-07 Sun>
