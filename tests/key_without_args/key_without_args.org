The first one won't be tangled.
#+begin_src sage :session
x = var('x')
#+end_src
This one will be tangled.
#+begin_src sage :session :tangle yes
φ = var('φ')
#+end_src
This one will also be tangled.
#+begin_src sage :tangle yes :session
f(φ) = cos(φ)
#+end_src
And this again will be tangled. The =mkdirp= is a no-op here, as we
do not give a directory. There is a separate test, which checks that
the option works correctly.
#+begin_src sage :tangle yes :session :mkdirp yes
f(123)
#+end_src
