#+TITLE: org-babel-tangle.py: the same, but faster

This is a reimplementation of the [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] function =org-babel-tangle=,
in Python, and about 100 times faster.  I wrote this because it took
about 5.5s to Org to tangle three files for a total of â‰…650 lines of
code, which was becoming more than irritating.

Usage is very simple, put this program somewhere in =$PATH=, then:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ org-babel-tangle myfile.org
wyag ................................................................. 4 lines
libwyag.py ......................................................... 598 lines
wyag-tests .......................................................... 75 lines
#+END_EXAMPLE

If no file is passed to command-line, it will read from =stdin=.

* Limitations

This program is extremely dumb, and lacks quite a few Org-mode
features, most notably [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-reference-syntax.html][noweb]].  But basically, all it does is routing
lines of text to output files and fixing indentation --- everything
else is unsupported.

I've done a few tests, and the files this program produces are
bit-for-bit identical to the real =org-babel-tangle= output.  If you
notice a difference, please open an issue.
